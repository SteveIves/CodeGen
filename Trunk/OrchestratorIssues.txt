============================

1.	In the Structure/Alias tab, I see structures from the Orchestrator repository, not the
	repository specified for a task. This is when running from Visual Studio, which may be
	relevent.

2.	Right now orchestrator is setup so that a task is only defined to process a single structure,
	but it is very common to want to generate from the same basic template and criteria,
	but for multiple structures. Need to allow any one task to specify one or more (no limit)
	structure names. The structure name(s) field also needs to support wildcards.

3.	Right now orchestrator is setup so that a task is only defined to process a single template,
	but it is very common to want to generate from the same basic structure and criteria,
	but using multiple templates. Need to allow any one task to specify one or more (no limit)
	template names. The Template name field needs to accept wildcard specifications. It is
	currently setup to be a full path to a single template file, but this is not the way that
	CodeGen works. Each task needs a template FOLDER field, that overrides the global template
	folder that is already defined.

4.	All path references, when referring to a location on the same drive as the project file,
	should be stored as RELATIVE paths. There should be no ABSOLUTE paths stored anywhere
	unless referring to something on a different drive.

5.  Need to add support for character height (-ch).

6.	Need to add support for FILE based processing (-file).

7.	Need to add support for multiple structure processing (-ms).

8.	Need to add support for subset processing (-subset).

9.  Need to add support for subset from field list processing (-fields).

10. Need to add support for file overrides (-fo).

11. Need to extend support for user defined tokens (-ut). Currently the template file is parsed
	for <REQUIRES_USERTOKEN> and <OPTIONAL_USERTOKEN> tokens, but what if the template does not
	declare it's requirements. It needs to be possible to hand-enter user token names and values.

12.	There is an issue with the enumeration that was added for the button processing options.
	because when creating a new project the default should be "None", but it defaults to a blank
	item in the listbox control.

13.	Need to add support for override primary key (-opk)

14.	Maybe add a button to launch the CodeGen documentation?

15. There needs to be a way to switch to a different project once in Orchestrator - maybe a menu
    with things like File > Open, and File Save? :)
