
Symphony Orchestrator Issues
============================

1.	The Replace existing files control should be a CheckBox, and seems to work the opposite
	way round. Setting NO causes the file to be replaced, and YES causes it not to be replaced!

2.	In the Structure/Alias tab, I see structures from the Orchestrator repository, not the
	repository specified for a task. This is when running from Visual Studio, which may be
	relevent.

3.	Consider making it remember the last project that was opened, and auto-restoring it on
	startup. Only display the file open dialog if there is no default, and add a button to
	the UI to allow the user to open a new project.
