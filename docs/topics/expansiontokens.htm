CodeGen recognizes and processes several different categories of expansion tokens.&nbsp; Some of these tokens can be used at any time, whilst others can only be used within a certain context in a template file.</span></p>
      <p class="ps1"><span class="ts2">Expansion tokens consist of a single tag (a special keyword delimited by less-than (&lt;) and greater-than (&gt;) characters) and most cause some value to be written to the output stream for the current template.&nbsp; An example of an expansion token of this type is the </span><a href="genericexpansiontokens.htm#%3CDATE%3E" class="hs9">&lt;DATE&gt;</a><span class="ts2">&nbsp;token that was discussed earlier.</span></p>
      <p class="ps1"><span class="ts2">When CodeGen processes a template file in order to create an output file it is constantly searching for known expansion tokens, and when a token is encountered some action is taken based on the name and nature of the token.</span></p>

      <p class="ps1"><span class="ts2">All expansion tokens are valid in upper case (as shown in this documentation) and many are valid only in upper case. Generally, when the name of an expansion token appears in uppercase, then the associated replacement text that is written to the output stream will also be in upper case. But there are some exceptions to this rule, typically when the token refers to a piece of metadata which resolves to a piece of &ldquo;free text&rdquo; such as descriptions that were entered as free text.</span></p>
      <p class="ps1"><span class="ts2">Some tokens are documented to have &quot;alternate forms&quot;.&nbsp; For example, the </span><a href="structureexpansiontokens.htm#STRUCTURE_NAME" class="hs9">&lt;STRUCTURE_NAME&gt;</a><span class="ts2">&nbsp;token, which normally outputs the name of the repository structure in all uppercase characters, has five alternate forms, as follows:</span></p>
